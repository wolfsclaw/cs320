To ensure that your code, program, or software is functional and secure, you must involve a combination of practices that start at the intitial development stage and continue through to the post-development stage of your SDLC.  You must make sure that you have planned your project out and ensured that you have the proper requirements that your client is asking for.  You must ensure that you are following the best practices while coding your project which includes: adhering to industry-standard guidelines, ensure that your code is validated and sanitized and to implement robust error handling to help prevent leaks of sensitive information.  Ensure that you are doing the proper testing of the software to ensure that your coding is done correctly.  These tests can include: Unit tests, integration tests, functional tests, security testing, and regression testing.  You can also have the system due automated tests to ensure that all your libraries and dependecies are up-to-date and from trusted sources. You also need to ensure that even after the software has launched, that you do regular updated and address any new vulnerabilities.  Continuously gather feedback from users to identify and fix and bugs or vulnerabilities that might have been missed in the initial launch.
